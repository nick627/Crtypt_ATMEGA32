# Crtypt_ATMEGA32
Interaction of MC and PC. Prototype cryptosystem

Organization of bi-directional interaction between the microcontroller and a personal computer. Introduction to RSA cryptosystem and Diffie-Hellman and El-Gamal cryptographic protocols.

Extras. Task (option 3):
Cryptosystem RSA. On the MK, statistics should be collected: the number of calls (encryption, decryption), the number of calls with the public key absent in memory, the total volume of encrypted and decrypted files. All statistics must be written to the EEPROM and transferred to the program on the PC for display.
